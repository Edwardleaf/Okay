								<h2 class="major">Who am I?</h2>
								I’m a fourth year electrical engineering student at SJSU 
								with multiple internships and a social personality. 
								When I’m not studying in the IEEE room at SJSU, 
								you can find me skateboarding down garages, up in the mountains, or attempting to develop content.

								<p>My first interview and internship was with Underwriters Laboratories, where I was an RF/EMC lab assistant. 
								Honestly, I did not believe I had this internship until I got my first paid check, it was surreal. 
								I learned so many soft and technical skills that helped kick started my career as an engineer. 
								I was exposed to excel programming and to UL's automated scripts. 
								I was part of writing the reports that were sent to FCC for verification. 
								I learned a lot about radio frequencys, especially the different bands related to cellular technology.</p>

								<p>My second internship was with Robert Bosch LLC, where I worked with their autnomous driving team. 
								I remember during the first day of work, I was given a linux computer and I had no clue how to use it. 
								Luckily, I caught on real quick, like the other things that were thrown at me. I learned how to use RViZ, an open source 3D visualizer for ROS files.
								I was also able to learn some C++, where I was able to implement markers and lines. I was partly responsible for the perception of our autonomous car.
