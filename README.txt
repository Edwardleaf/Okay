Hello whoever reads a README.txt

I used a template from HTML5 UP and made a few changes to make it more to my liking. Here's the list below,

-(/given) change all the photos
-had to update to a new FontAwesome css toolkit because I needed to use newer logos/icons
-register all the icons in contact me to personal links




The purpose of making a website?

-wanted to create content/advertise myself
